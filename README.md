How Dark Mode Improves Readability & Accessibility

1️⃣ Reduces Eye Strain – Dark mode minimizes glare, especially in low-light conditions, making it easier to read for extended periods.

2️⃣ Enhances Contrast & Legibility – Using high-contrast text (light text on a dark background) improves readability, especially for users with visual impairments.

3️⃣ Supports Accessibility Standards – Following WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) ensures proper contrast ratios, making content accessible for people with low vision.

4️⃣ Reduces Blue Light Exposure – Dark mode reduces blue light, which can help prevent eye fatigue and improve sleep quality for users reading at night.

5️⃣ Battery Efficiency – On OLED and AMOLED screens, dark mode consumes less power, providing a better experience for mobile users.

By implementing dark mode with proper contrast adjustments, we ensure that all users, including those with visual impairments, can comfortably read news articles anytime.
